# Welcome to the GCentral Indexer Repository!

This repository contains the GCentral Indexer, the back-end implementation and front end presentation of VI Packages, NI Packages, and G Packages in various repositories, inducing GCentral's own repositories. The indexer is displayed in GCentral.org and represents the "Find / Discover" portion of the mission. 
GCentral's goal is to empower the community to build GCentral into the tool it needs. Therefore we are open-sourcing as much of the indexer and website as possible so you can lend your passion and expertise to the cause.

Pease see [GCentral.org](https://www.gcentral.org/support/collaborate) for detailed instructions how to setup your development environment to work on the indexer.

### Above all, thank you for sacrificing your time and using your skills and talents and passion to build GCentral.
