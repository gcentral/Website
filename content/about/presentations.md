## GLA Summit 2022: G Idea Exchange: Empowering Your Open Source LabVIEW Ideas

Do you have the next great idea for an open-source toolkit in LabVIEW but need help implementing it? Would you like to help new upcoming toolkits get funded and get initialized? Is your company looking for an open-source project to invest in? The G Idea Exchange is a sub-committee under the non-profit GCentral. It promotes and supports new open-source toolkits and ideas for improving LabVIEW, helping open-source ideas get off the ground.
