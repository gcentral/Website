### Project Description

The LabVIEW Community Trainining initiative is a result of the great work performed by [Steve Watts](https://www.linkedin.com/in/swatzy/) and [Derrick Bommarito](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dabommarito/). The purpose of the initiative is to reduce the complexity of setting up a LabVIEW Linux environment on a VM, making it easier to get started learning LabVIEW. The VM can be downloaded [here](https://downloads.gcentral.org/vm/20231021_OpenSUSE_CTIBase.ova) (size approximately 8Gb).

To get started with the image follow the instruction within the provided documentation.
The Community Training Image can be used for personal learning and for non-academic training for learning LabVIEW, as well as be used for creating your own custom training curiculum.

### GCentrals involvement

At GCentral we cover the hosting of the VM image and documentation. This makes it easier for developers to get access to the latest version.
