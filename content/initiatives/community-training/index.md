### Description

The LabVIEW Community Trainining initiative is a result of the great work performed by [Steve Watts](https://www.linkedin.com/in/swatzy/) and [Derrick Bommarito](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dabommarito/). The purpose of the initiative is to reduce the complexity of setting up a LabVIEW Linux environment on a VM. The VM can be downloaded [here](https://downloads.gcentral.org/vm/20231021_OpenSUSE_CTIBase.ova) (size approximately 8Gb).
