## Getting Started with the CTI
1. [Download the CTI VM](https://downloads.gcentral.org/vm/LabVIEW-CTI-Student-Image-Lubuntu-20250225-1.ova) (~ 4.7 GB download). 
2. Read the setup and getting started instructions [here](https://labviewcommunitytraining.github.io/cti-documentation/en/latest/index.html) 

## Learning LabVIEW
The LabVIEW community has a rich and vibrant ecosystem. Visit the Community Resources Page to learn more about the resources at your disposal such as  

 - The LabVIEW Wiki: the community's online wiki
 - VIPM.IO: find and download community code

Much more on the  [Community Hub Page]({{< ref categories >}}) so be sure to visit it.

## Help Keep the CTI Available
{{< alert >}}Help ensure the CTI is always available by <a href="../howtosponsor">supporting GCentral</a> today!{{< /alert >}}

GCentral's [mission]({{< ref visionandmission >}}) is to enable the LabVIEW community to make the best version of itself by removing barriers to collaboration. GCentral is honored to work with [Steve Watts](https://www.linkedin.com/in/swatzy/) and [Derrick Bommarito](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dabommarito/) to deliver the CTI to you. The CTI is a manifestation of their passion and dedication to bringing LabVIEW to the world!

GCentral is honored to host the files, but needs your help. If you have benefited from the CTI and/or want to make sure it remains available for others to download please [contribute to GCentral today]({{< ref howtodonate >}}).

<p>Derrick Bommarito enjoys experimenting with all the LabVIEW features that DNatt advises against, which he hopes characterizes him as chaotic good. He particularly enjoys creating tooling for developers, exploring the more obscure aspects of LabVIEW such as Channels, XNodes, and VIMs, and generating bug reports as a result of his investigations. Derrick also finds pleasure in experimenting with architecture and API design within the LabVIEW environment. His many hobbies include breaking LabVIEW and tinkering with too many side projects; from the web, to robotics, to gardening, to baking.</p>
